# Ethers Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts for learning and experimenting with the ethers.js library. The scripts are organized by day, with each day focusing on a different aspect of the library.

## Day 1: Providers and Wallets

This day focuses on the basic concepts of ethers.js, like providers and wallets.

*   `providers.js`: Demonstrates how to connect to an Ethereum node and perform basic operations like getting the block number, resolving ENS names, and getting balances.
*   `wallets.js`: Demonstrates how to create wallets, derive wallets from a mnemonic, sign messages, and send transactions.

## Day 2: Interacting with Smart Contracts

This day focuses on how to interact with smart contracts using ethers.js.

*   `contract_read.js`: Demonstrates how to read data from a smart contract.
*   `contract_write.js`: Demonstrates how to write data to a smart contract.
*   `contract_calldata.js`: Demonstrates how to manually encode function data (calldata) for more advanced use cases.
*   The `abi` directory contains the ABIs for the contracts used in the scripts.

## Day 3: Local Development

This day focuses on using ethers.js with a local development environment.

*   `providers.js`: Demonstrates how to connect to a local Ethereum node.
